# Production Logging Guidelines

## Current Logging Status

The SFMC Toolkit Labs edition has been cleaned up to remove excessive debug logging while keeping essential operational logs.

## Logging Categories

### ✅ **KEEP - Essential Logs:**
- Security setup warnings
- Server startup confirmation  
- Error messages
- Authentication status
- Critical operation results

### ✅ **KEEP - Helpful Info Logs:**
- Environment validation
- Major process starts/completions
- API endpoint hits
- Data collection summaries

### ❌ **REMOVED - Debug Logs:**
- Raw API response dumps
- Detailed object inspection
- Step-by-step process traces
- Development debugging statements

### ❌ **REMOVED - Debug Files:**
- `debug_de_selection.js` - Development debugging file

## For Further Cleanup

If you need even quieter logging for production:

1. **Environment Variable Control:**
   - Add `LOG_LEVEL=error` to suppress info logs
   - Add `LOG_LEVEL=silent` to suppress all non-error logs

2. **Replace console.log with Logger:**
   - Consider using a proper logging library like `winston`
   - Implement log levels (error, warn, info, debug)

3. **Production Hardening:**
   - Remove remaining development-style emoji logs
   - Implement structured JSON logging
   - Add log rotation for production deployments

## Current State
The codebase now has production-appropriate logging that:
- ✅ Helps with troubleshooting
- ✅ Doesn't expose sensitive data  
- ✅ Provides clear status information
- ✅ Avoids overwhelming log output
